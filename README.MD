One or two sentence summary of your project. 

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories.

To create a GIF, use [LiceCap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/), [RecordIt](http://www.recordit.co), or [Loom](http://www.useloom.com), and link the image here in the markdown.

## Required Stories

The following **required** functionalities are completed:

* [x] The user can see a list of the 20 latest top news stories, loaded dynamically from newsapi.
* [x] For each story, the user sees a headline, the source, a link to more, and an image.
* [x] The user can see the total number of stories currently shown.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Add favicon to the page
* [x] The user can click a link at the bottom of the page to load the next 20 stories. The page should not refresh; the stories should simply be added to the bottom.
* [x] The user can see an updated number of stories currently shown.
* [x] Add favicon to the page
* [x] The user can see how long ago the story was published in a human-friendly format; e.g. "15 minutes ago". To accomplish this, we recommend you use momentjs. Please load it into your page using cdnjs or jsdelivr (these are called CDNs).

## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total.

It has been very challenging to implement and interact with an API, but at the same time it is motivating to understand the amount of data that you can manage. I am going to keep working hard improve my technical skills.
